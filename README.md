# air-travel
The Air Travel project revolved around classes, objects and containers (i.e: dictionaries and sets). Objects of two different classes: Airport and Flight, would be made based on the information gathered from airportFile and flightFile. These objects would then be stored in their respective containers, which would be accessed later by the tester files.
